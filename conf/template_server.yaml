# outbound address, if server has more than one ip
# inbound and outbound connection can have different ip
# can hides the link between inbound and outbound traffic

# min a max waiting data time (ms) before close the connection
# needed to prevent probe for header size
# reads random number of bytes, at most u16::MAX (65535)
# random timeout for the read is selected in specified range

# The setting below MUST be the same on client and server
##

# maximum delay before client connect to server (replay protection)
# should be the same for server and client
# 10000 (10 sec) default
# max_connect_delay: 10000

# min a max header padding in bytes
# header_padding: 50..777

# data random padding
# max: maximum number of bytes of padding, default 255. Max value is 65535.
# rate: a ratio of padding size to payload size as a percentage. default is 20 (padding is 20% of payload). Max value is 100.
# zero rate or max means no padding
# data_padding:
#   max: 255
#   rate: 20

# encryption limit
# default is usize::MAX (encrypt all data)
# can be used to avoid triple encryption in https mode
# zero is not recommened, better set something like 1024
# client and server hallo are not fully encrypted so it's ok to encrypt it twice :-)
# encryption_limit: 1024
